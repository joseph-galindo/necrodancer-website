							li Does 1-3 damage on contact with all three enemies that directly neighbor the character

								ul.explanation
									li Stopping certain enemies mid-attack cycle (locks mushrooms in their current attack state, can also redirect Dead Ringer)
									li Pinning enemies to walls (used heavily with almost all mini-bosses)
									li If the coin multiplier is at 1x (0 kills chained), the flail does 1 damage
									li If the coin multiplier is at 2x (2-4 kills chained), the flail does 2 damage
									li If the coin multiplier is at 3x (5+ kills chained), the flail does 3 damage
